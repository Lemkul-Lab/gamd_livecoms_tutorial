	abstract = {Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) is a robust computational method for simultaneous unconstrained enhanced sampling and free energy calculations of biomolecules. It works by adding a harmonic boost potential to smooth biomolecular potential energy surface and reduce energy barriers. GaMD greatly accelerates biomolecular simulations by orders of magnitude. Without the need to set predefined reaction coordinates or collective variables, GaMD provides unconstrained enhanced sampling and is advantageous for simulating complex biological processes. The GaMD boost potential exhibits a Gaussian distribution, thereby allowing for energetic reweighting via cumulant expansion to the second order (i.e., “Gaussian approximation”). This leads to accurate reconstruction of free energy landscapes of biomolecules. Hybrid schemes with other enhanced sampling methods, such as the replica-exchange GaMD (rex-GaMD) and replica-exchange umbrella sampling GaMD (GaREUS), have also been introduced, further improving sampling and free energy calculations. Recently, new “selective GaMD” algorithms including the Ligand GaMD (LiGaMD) and Peptide GaMD (Pep-GaMD) enabled microsecond simulations to capture repetitive dissociation and binding of small-molecule ligands and highly flexible peptides. The simulations then allowed highly efficient quantitative characterization of the ligand/peptide binding thermodynamics and kinetics. Taken together, GaMD and its innovative variants are applicable to simulate a wide variety of biomolecular dynamics, including protein folding, conformational changes and allostery, ligand binding, peptide binding, protein–protein/nucleic acid/carbohydrate interactions, and carbohydrate/nucleic acid interactions. In this review, we present principles of the GaMD algorithms and recent applications in biomolecular simulations and drug design.

	abstract = {We introduce a novel multilevel enhanced sampling strategy grounded on Gaussian-accelerated Molecular Dynamics (GaMD). First, we propose a GaMD multi-GPUs-accelerated implementation within the Tinker-HP molecular dynamics package. We introduce the new "dual-water"mode and its use with the flexible AMOEBA polarizable force field. By adding harmonic boosts to the water stretching and bonding terms, it accelerates the solvent-solute interactions while enabling speedups, thanks to the use of fast multiple-time step integrators. To further reduce the time-to-solution, we couple GaMD to Umbrella Sampling (US). The GaMD-US/dual-water approach is tested on the 1D Potential of Mean Force (PMF) of the solvated CD2-CD58 system (168 000 atoms), allowing the AMOEBA PMF to converge within 1 kcal/mol of the experimental value. Finally, Adaptive Sampling (AS) is added, enabling AS-GaMD capabilities but also the introduction of the new Adaptive Sampling-US-GaMD (ASUS-GaMD) scheme. The highly parallel ASUS-GaMD setup decreases time to convergence by, respectively, 10 and 20 times, compared to GaMD-US and US. Overall, beside the acceleration of PMF computations, Tinker-HP now allows for the simultaneous use of Adaptive Sampling and GaMD-"dual water"enhanced sampling approaches increasing the applicability of polarizable force fields to large-scale simulations of biological systems.},

	abstract = {CHARMM (Chemistry at HARvard Molecular Mechanics) is a highly versatile and widely used molecular simulation program. It has been developed over the last three decades with a primary focus on molecules of biological interest, including proteins, peptides, lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and small molecule ligands, as they occur in solution, crystals, and membrane environments. For the study of such systems, the program provides a large suite of computational tools that include numerous conformational and path sampling methods, free energy estimators, molecular minimization, dynamics, and analysis techniques, and model-building capabilities. In addition, the CHARMM program is applicable to problems involving a much broader class of many-particle systems. Calculations with CHARMM can be performed using a number of different energy functions and models, from mixed quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical force fields, to all-atom classical potential energy functions with explicit solvent and various boundary conditions, to implicit solvent and membrane models. The program has been ported to numerous platforms in both serial and parallel architectures. This paper provides an overview of the program as it exists today with an emphasis on developments since the publication of the original CHARMM paper in 1983.},

	abstract = {Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) is a recently developed enhanced sampling technique that provides efficient free energy calculations of biomolecules. Like the previous accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD), GaMD allows for “unconstrained” enhanced sampling without the need to set predefined collective variables and so is useful for studying complex biomolecular conformational changes such as protein folding and ligand binding. Furthermore, because the boost potential is constructed using a harmonic function that follows Gaussian distribution in GaMD, cumulant expansion to the second order can be applied to recover the original free energy profiles of proteins and other large biomolecules, which solves a long-standing energetic reweighting problem of the previous aMD method. Taken together, GaMD offers major advantages for both unconstrained enhanced sampling and free energy calculations of large biomolecules. Here, we have implemented GaMD in the NAMD package on top of the existing aMD feature and validated it on three model systems: alanine dipeptide, the chignolin fast-folding protein, and the M3 muscarinic G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). For alanine dipeptide, while conventional molecular dynamics (cMD) simulations performed for 30 ns are poorly converged, GaMD simulations of the same length yield free energy profiles that agree quantitatively with those of 1000 ns cMD simulation. Further GaMD simulations have captured folding of the chignolin and binding of the acetylcholine (ACh) endogenous agonist to the M3 muscarinic receptor. The reweighted free energy profiles are used to characterize the protein folding and ligand binding pathways quantitatively. GaMD implemented in the scalable NAMD is widely applicable to enhanced sampling and free energy calculations of large biomolecules.},

	abstract = {Accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) simulations greatly improve the efficiency of conventional molecular dynamics (cMD) for sampling biomolecular conformations, but they require proper reweighting for free energy calculation. In this work, we systematically compare the accuracy of different reweighting algorithms including the exponential average, Maclaurin series, and cumulant expansion on three model systems: alanine dipeptide, chignolin, and Trp-cage. Exponential average reweighting can recover the original free energy profiles easily only when the distribution of the boost potential is narrow (e.g., the range ≤20kBT) as found in dihedral-boost aMD simulation of alanine dipeptide. In dual-boost aMD simulations of the studied systems, exponential average generally leads to high energetic fluctuations, largely due to the fact that the Boltzmann reweighting factors are dominated by a very few high boost potential frames. In comparison, reweighting based on Maclaurin series expansion (equivalent to cumulant expansion on the first order) greatly suppresses the energetic noise but often gives incorrect energy minimum positions and significant errors at the energy barriers (∼2–3kBT). Finally, reweighting using cumulant expansion to the second order is able to recover the most accurate free energy profiles within statistical errors of ∼kBT, particularly when the distribution of the boost potential exhibits low anharmonicity (i.e., near-Gaussian distribution), and should be of wide applicability.

GaMD is unable to give time-dependent properties such as kinetics directly. On the other hand, the weighted ensemble (WE) method can efficiently sample transitions between states with its many weighted trajectories, which directly yield rates and pathways. However, convergence to equilibrium conditions remains a challenge for the WE method. Hence, we have developed a hybrid method that combines the two methods, wherein GaMD is first used to sample the potential energy landscape of the system and WE is subsequently used to further sample the potential energy landscape and kinetic properties of interest. We show that the hybrid method can sample both thermodynamic and kinetic properties more accurately and quickly compared to using either method alone.},

	abstract = {Various advanced simulation techniques, which are used to sample the statistical ensemble of systems with complex Hamiltonians, such as those displayed in condensed matters and biomolecular systems, rely heavily on successfully reweighting the sampled configurations. The sampled points of a system from an elevated thermal environment or on a modified Hamiltonian are reused with different statistical weights to evaluate its properties at the initial desired temperature or of the original Hamiltonian. Often, the decrease of accuracy induced by this procedure is ignored and the final results can be far from what is expected. We have addressed the reasons behind such a phenomenon and have provided a quantitative method to estimate the number of sampled points required in the crucial step of reweighting of these advanced simulation methods. We also provided examples from temperature histogram reweighting and accelerated molecular dynamics reweighting to illustrate this idea, which can be generalized to the dynamic reweighting as well. The study shows that this analysis may provide a priori guidance for the strategy of setting up the parameters of advanced simulations before a lengthy one is carried out. The method can therefore provide insights for optimizing the parameters for high accuracy simulations with finite amount of computational resources.},

However, in our previous approach, large-amplitude displacements of biomolecules are still slowed by the diffusion of the solvent. Here we present a unified approach of efficiently sampling both the torsional degrees of freedom and the diffusive motions concurrently.

This work continues to improve the acceleration power and energy reweighting of the GaMD by combining the GaMD with replica exchange algorithms. Two versions of replica exchange GaMD (rex-GaMD) are presented: force constant rex-GaMD and threshold energy rex-GaMD. During simulations of force constant rex-GaMD, the boost potential can be exchanged between replicas of different harmonic force constants with fixed threshold energy. However, the algorithm of threshold energy rex-GaMD tends to switch the threshold energy between lower and upper bounds for generating different levels of boost potential. Testing simulations on three model systems, including the alanine dipeptide, chignolin, and HIV protease, demonstrate that through continuous exchanges of the boost potential, the rex-GaMD simulations not only enhance the conformational transitions of the systems but also narrow down the distribution width of the applied boost potential for accurate energetic reweighting to recover biomolecular free energy profiles.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have become increasingly popular in studying the motions and functions of biomolecules. The accuracy of the simulation, however, is highly determined by the molecular mechanics (MM) force field (FF), a set of functions with adjustable parameters to compute the potential energies from atomic positions. However, the overall quality of the FF, such as our previously published ff99SB and ff14SB, can be limited by assumptions that were made years ago. In the updated model presented here (ff19SB), we have significantly improved the backbone profiles for all 20 amino acids. We fit coupled φ/ψ parameters using 2D φ/ψ conformational scans for multiple amino acids, using as reference data the entire 2D quantum mechanics (QM) energy surface. We address the polarization inconsistency during dihedral parameter fitting by using both QM and MM in aqueous solution. Finally, we examine possible dependency of the backbone fitting on side chain rotamer. To extensively validate ff19SB parameters, and to compare to results using other Amber models, we have performed a total of ∼5 ms MD simulations in explicit solvent. Our results show that after amino-acid-specific training against QM data with solvent polarization, ff19SB not only reproduces the differences in amino-acid-specific Protein Data Bank (PDB) Ramachandran maps better but also shows significantly improved capability to differentiate amino-acid-dependent properties such as helical propensities. We also conclude that an inherent underestimation of helicity is present in ff14SB, which is (inexactly) compensated for by an increase in helical content driven by the TIP3P bias toward overly compact structures. In summary, ff19SB, when combined with a more accurate water model such as OPC, should have better predictive power for modeling sequence-specific behavior, protein mutations, and also rational protein design. Of the explicit water models tested here, we recommend use of OPC with ff19SB.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) allows the study of biological and chemical systems at the atomistic level on timescales from femtoseconds to milliseconds. It complements experiment while also offering a way to follow processes difficult to discern with experimental techniques. Numerous software packages exist for conducting MD simulations of which one of the widest used is termed Amber. Here, we outline the most recent developments, since version 9 was released in April 2006, of the Amber and AmberTools MD software packages, referred to here as simply the Amber package. The latest release represents six years of continued development, since version 9, by multiple research groups and the culmination of over 33 years of work beginning with the first version in 1979. The latest release of the Amber package, version 12 released in April 2012, includes a substantial number of important developments in both the scientific and computer science arenas. We present here a condensed vision of what Amber currently supports and where things are likely to head over the coming years. Figure 1 shows the performance in ns/day of the Amber package version 12 on a single-core AMD FX-8120 8-Core 3.6GHz CPU, the Cray XT5 system, and a single GPU GTX680. © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

GaMD is an unconstrained enhanced sampling technique that allows for exploration of the conformational space of proteins and understanding of complex biological interactions that often occur on millisecond and longer timescales. The boost potential in GaMD usually exhibits a Gaussian distribution, enabling accurate reweighting of the simulations using cumulant expansion to the second order. Recently developed “selective GaMD” algorithms such as ligand GaMD (LiGaMD), peptide GaMD (Pep-GaMD), and protein–protein interaction GaMD (PPI-GaMD) have enabled microsecond-timescale all-atom simulations to characterize the binding thermodynamics and kinetics of small molecules, flexible peptides, and proteins. GaMD has been successfully applied to reveal the mechanisms of ligand/drug binding to various biomolecules (including GPCRs, nucleic acids, and human ACE2 receptors), as well as generating protein structures for virtual screening in drug discovery.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations often struggle to obtain sufficient sampling to study complex molecular events due to high energy barriers separating the minima of interest. Multiple enhanced sampling techniques have been developed and improved over the years to tackle this issue. Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) is a recently developed enhanced sampling technique that works by adding a biasing potential, lifting the energy landscape up, and decreasing the height of its barriers. GaMD allows one to increase the sampling of events of interest without the need of a priori knowledge of the system or the relevant coordinates. All required acceleration parameters can be obtained from a previous search run. Upon its development, several improvements for the methodology have been proposed, among them selective GaMD in which the boosting potential is selectively applied to the region of interest. There are currently four selective GaMD methods that have shown promising results. However, all of these methods are constrained on the number, location, and scenarios in which this selective boosting potential can be applied to ligands, peptides, or protein–protein interactions. In this work, we showcase a GROMOS implementation of the GaMD methodology with a fully flexible selective GaMD approach that allows the user to define, in a straightforward way, multiple boosting potentials for as many regions as desired. We show and analyze the advantages of this flexible selective approach on two previously used test systems, the alanine dipeptide and the chignolin peptide, and extend these examples to study its applicability and potential to study conformational changes of glycans and glycosylated proteins.},

However, it is challenging to simulate both binding and unbinding of peptides and calculate peptide binding free energies through conventional molecular dynamics, due to long biological timescales and extremely high flexibility of the peptides. Based on the Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) enhanced sampling technique, we have developed a new computational method “Pep-GaMD,” which selectively boosts essential potential energy of the peptide in order to effectively model its high flexibility. In addition, another boost potential is applied to the remaining potential energy of the entire system in a dual-boost algorithm. Pep-GaMD has been demonstrated on binding of three model peptides to the SH3 domains. Independent 1 µs dual-boost Pep-GaMD simulations have captured repetitive peptide dissociation and binding events, which enable us to calculate peptide binding thermodynamics and kinetics. The calculated binding free energies and kinetic rate constants agreed very well with available experimental data. Furthermore, the all-atom Pep-GaMD simulations have provided important insights into the mechanism of peptide binding to proteins that involves long-range electrostatic interactions and mainly conformational selection. In summary, Pep-GaMD provides a highly efficient, easy-to-use approach for unconstrained enhanced sampling and calculations of peptide binding free energies and kinetics.},

However, it has proven challenging to simulate repetitive protein association and dissociation in order to calculate binding free energies and kinetics of PPIs due to long biological timescales and complex protein dynamics. To address this challenge, we have developed a new computational approach to all-atom simulations of PPIs based on a robust Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) technique. The method, termed “PPI-GaMD”, selectively boosts interaction potential energy between protein partners to facilitate their slow dissociation. Meanwhile, another boost potential is applied to the remaining potential energy of the entire system to effectively model the protein’s flexibility and rebinding. PPI-GaMD has been demonstrated on a model system of the ribonuclease barnase interactions with its inhibitor barstar. Six independent 2 μs PPI-GaMD simulations have captured repetitive barstar dissociation and rebinding events, which enable calculations of the protein binding thermodynamics and kinetics simultaneously. The calculated binding free energies and kinetic rate constants agree well with the experimental data. Furthermore, PPI-GaMD simulations have provided mechanistic insights into barstar binding to barnase, which involves long-range electrostatic interactions and multiple binding pathways, being consistent with previous experimental and computational findings of this model system. In summary, PPI-GaMD provides a highly efficient and easy-to-use approach for binding free energy and kinetics calculations of PPIs.},

Based on our previously developed Ligand Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (LiGaMD), here we present LiGaMD2 in which a selective boost potential was applied to both the ligand and protein residues in the binding pocket to improve sampling of ligand binding and dissociation. To validate the performance of LiGaMD2, the T4 lysozyme (T4L) mutants with open and closed pockets bound by different ligands were chosen as model systems. LiGaMD2 could efficiently capture repetitive ligand dissociation and binding within microsecond simulations of all T4L systems. The obtained ligand binding kinetic rates and free energies agreed well with available experimental values and previous modeling results. Therefore, LiGaMD2 provides an improved approach to sample opening of closed protein pockets for ligand dissociation and binding, thereby allowing for efficient calculations of ligand binding thermodynamics and kinetics.},

Another boost potential could be applied to the remaining potential energy of the entire system in a dual-boost algorithm (LiGaMD\_Dual) to facilitate ligand binding. LiGaMD has been demonstrated on host–guest and protein–ligand binding model systems. Repetitive guest binding and unbinding in the β-cyclodextrin host were observed in hundreds-of-nanosecond LiGaMD\_Dual simulations. The calculated guest binding free energies agreed excellently with experimental data with {\textless}1.0 kcal/mol errors. Compared with converged microsecond-time scale conventional molecular dynamics simulations, the sampling errors of LiGaMD\_Dual simulations were also {\textless}1.0 kcal/mol. Accelerations of ligand kinetic rate constants in LiGaMD simulations were properly estimated using Kramers’ rate theory. Furthermore, LiGaMD allowed us to capture repetitive dissociation and binding of the benzamidine inhibitor in trypsin within 1 μs simulations. The calculated ligand binding free energy and kinetic rate constants compared well with the experimental data. In summary, LiGaMD provides a powerful enhanced sampling approach for characterizing ligand binding thermodynamics and kinetics simultaneously, which is expected to facilitate computer-aided drug design.},

By adding harmonic boosts to the water stretching and bonding terms, it accelerates the solvent-solute interactions while enabling speedups thanks to the use of fast multiple–timestep integrators. To further reduce time-to-solution, we couple GaMD to Umbrella Sampling (US). The GaMD—US/dual–water approach is tested on the 1D Potential of Mean Force (PMF) of the CD2–CD58 system (168000 atoms) allowing the AMOEBA PMF to converge within 1 kcal/mol of the experimental value. Finally, Adaptive Sampling (AS) is added enabling AS–GaMD capabilities but also the introduction of the new Adaptive Sampling–US–GaMD (ASUS–GaMD) scheme. The highly parallel ASUS–GaMD setup decreases time to convergence by respectively 10 and 20 compared to GaMD–US and US.},

Molecular dynamics simulation has been routinely used to understand conformational dynamics and molecular recognition in biomolecules. Statistical analysis of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data generated from molecular dynamics simulation requires identification of a few low-dimensional variables which can describe the essential dynamics of a system without significant loss of information. In physical chemistry, these low-dimensional variables are often called collective variables. Collective variables are used to generate reduced representations of free energy surfaces and calculate transition probabilities between different metastable basins. However the choice of collective variables is not trivial for complex systems. Collective variables range from geometric criteria such as distances and dihedral angles to abstract ones such as weighted linear combinations of multiple geometric variables. The advent of machine learning algorithms led to increasing use of abstract collective variables to represent biomolecular dynamics. In this review, I will highlight several nuances of commonly used collective variables ranging from geometric to abstract ones. Further, I will put forward some cases where machine learning based collective variables were used to describe simple systems which in principle could have been described by geometric ones. Finally, I will put forward my thoughts on artificial general intelligence and how it can be used to discover and predict collective variables from spatiotemporal data generated by molecular dynamics simulations.},

    abstract = {A new method for performing molecular dynamics simulations under constant pressure is presented. In the method, which is based on the extended system formalism introduced by Andersen, the deterministic equations of motion for the piston degree of freedom are replaced by a Langevin equation; a suitable choice of collision frequency then eliminates the unphysical ‘‘ringing’’ of the volume associated with the piston mass. In this way it is similar to the ‘‘weak coupling algorithm’’ developed by Berendsen and co‐workers to perform molecular dynamics simulation without piston mass effects. It is shown, however, that the weak coupling algorithm induces artifacts into the simulation which can be quite severe for inhomogeneous systems such as aqueous biopolymers or liquid/liquid interfaces.},

Phys. 119 (2003) 5185], based on classical Drude oscillators, is re-optimized for negatively charged Drude particles. The new model, called SWM4-NDP, will be incorporated into a polarizable biomolecular force field currently in development. It is calibrated to reproduce important properties of the neat liquid at room temperature and pressure: vaporization enthalpy, density, static dielectric constant and self-diffusion constant. In this Letter, we also show that it yields the correct liquid shear viscosity and free energy of hydration.}
