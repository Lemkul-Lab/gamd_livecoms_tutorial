# Tutorial Files for Running Gaussian-accelerated Molecular Dynamics Simulations in NAMD
Input files for GaMD in NAMD tutorials written for the *Living Journal of Computational Molecular Science*

## Usage 
The ```tutorial-files``` directory contains all files in order to complete the tutorials. 
Simulations scripts can be found within their associated force field directory (i.e. c36m, Drude, ff19sb). 
These include all NAMD parameter files, submission scripts, and any GaMD post-processing requried prior to reweighting.
The ```reweight``` directory contains all files required to reweight the simulation, generate free energy surfaces, and pinpoint minima. 

The associated manuscript is under review at the journal and citation details will be added here when available.
